        "description": "If you live in Australia or New Zealand, you’ve likely heard of AMP. But at a time when society is changing, we are too. We’re now a nimbler business with new leadership and thinking.\n\n\nFor us, these are exciting times. There’s a real potential for big thinkers to help us redefine what financial services could be. And turn our legacy into something even more positive and powerful for the future.\n\n\n**Help people create their tomorrow, while you create yours**\n\nWe help people with their banking, super, retirement and finances. Through upturns, downturns, recessions, and major life transitions. Every day, we help people see and make more of their financial potential, so that they can create their tomorrow. And we’ve been doing it for over 170 years.\n\n\nIf we do our job well, we genuinely add to the prosperity of our country and its people.\n\n\n**How you'll make an impact**\n\nAs a Lead Business Analyst in AMP's North Technology team, you'll be the critical bridge between business strategy and technological execution for one of the leading Wrap platforms in the Wealth market. Your role will be pivotal in translating complex business objectives into actionable requirements that drive innovative solutions across the North platform. By working closely with stakeholders from Client Services, Platform, Product, and Sales \\& Distribution teams, you'll shape the strategic direction of a best\\-in\\-class wealth management solution, ensuring that technology delivers tangible business value and meets the evolving needs of financial services.\n\n\n**What you will bring to the role**\n\nYou'll bring deep expertise in business analysis, with a comprehensive understanding of both Agile and Waterfall delivery methodologies and extensive experience in Wrap, Wealth and Superannuation platforms. Your exceptional stakeholder management skills, combined with strong technical acumen, will allow you to effectively navigate complex organisational landscapes, facilitate critical workshops and produce high\\-quality requirements that bridge business and technology teams. Your ability to coach and mentor other Business Analysts, coupled with your strategic thinking and process improvement mindset, will be crucial in driving continuous innovation and delivering cost\\-effective, scalable solutions.\n\n\n**You’ll thrive here if…**\n\nIf you can adapt from BAU to the ambiguous with ease, you’ll do well here. Change is never easy, so bring your commitment, grit and growth mindset.\n\n\nBecause we run lean, you’ll be expected to jump in and deliver across a variety of areas. Meaning, you’ll be closer to the action and executive decisions that influence where we go next.\n\n\nIf you’re someone that can hold their own, you’ll find AMP quite liberating.\n\n\n**Why we think you’ll love working at AMP**\n\nDoing what we’ve always done is not an option, so your clever ideas will get airtime here. You’ll be encouraged to speak up and try new things. If they don’t work, we move on – better for it.\n\n\nWe know there’s no one way of doing things. So, you won’t have to sacrifice who you are or how you work to fit in here. We’re inclusive and flexible in many of the ways you’d expect. And in some of the ways you wouldn’t. As long as your health and wellbeing come first \\- at home and at work.\n\n\nIn fact, most of what makes AMP such a welcoming, enjoyable place to work are our people. Wherever you go, you’ll find moments to connect, feel valued and do meaningful work.\n\n\nWhether it’s through our first\\-class leaders who are invested in you and your success. Through year\\-round opportunities to volunteer, fundraise and give back to the community. Or in the everyday challenges you face as we work together to strengthen this great organisation. Challenges that will stretch you, amplify your potential and compound the impact you have.  \n\n\n\n  \n\n**We believe in the power of inclusion and diversity**\n\nWe’re dedicated to fostering inclusion, diversity, and a warm feeling of belonging at AMP. It sparks creativity, ignites innovation, and turns up the dial on the quality of our decisions and performance. This not only makes our workplace more engaged, but also leads to better connections with our customers.\n\n\nWe're your allies in the search for the perfect fit \\- when you apply, let us know how we can support you to put your best self forward during our selection process.\n\n\nWe're also committed to enhancing employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, so we enthusiastically encourage candidates from these backgrounds to apply and explore our Reconciliation Plan on our website\n\n\n**Ready to create your tomorrow?**\n\nIf you’re someone who sees opportunity where others see challenge, come and work with us in smart, progressive ways as we transform an iconic Australian brand for the future. And, through a series of career\\-defining moments, create your own tomorrow.\n\n\nDon’t procrastinate! We review applications when we get them, and if we discover the ideal candidate, we may close the role earlier than the advertised close date.\n\n\nLooking forward to meeting you.",
